Each page inside the attachment library contains approximately 20 attachments. Users can advanced through the pages of attachments by clicking on either the left or right arrow located at the top and a bottom of the screen, or by clicking on a specific page number.

Each attachment listing displays a thumbnail, title, description, and meta data. Users can view the attachment by clicking on its file name displayed after the header "filename."

## Editing Attachment entries
